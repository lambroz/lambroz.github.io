<p>Financial services consultants by day, and adamant hikers whenever on leave, Gian and Frank consolidated a bucket list of 121 trails (1st iteration) which are considered to be worth doing during a lifetime.</p>

<p>As the 1st iteration was based solely on personal experience and desktop research, Gian and Frank seek to refine the bucket list by nurturing and engaging a community of hikers, whose recommendations and suggestions will help shape the Ultmate World’s Trails Bucket List.</p>

<p>And that’s where “NFTs for Backpackers” come into play. We plan to release 121 NFTs, one for each trail of the 1st iteration of the bucket list.  The NFTs will be available on OpenSea on the Polygon blockchain.</p>

<p>At the same time, we are producing a podcast “NFTs for Backpackers”, which initially will focus on what the scope of our project is and explain the technicalities of launching the NFTs on Opensea. Eventually we will start discussing the trails of the bucket list.</p>

<p>To engage the community and fuel discussions, we started an “NFTs for Backpackers” Instagram account as well. All comments, suggestions and pools’ info gathered through social media, the podcasts and Opensea will be an integral part of our journey to refine our bucket list by replacing trails which the people do not deem worthy to be among the 121 we chose. This will be the 2nd iteration of the bucket list.</p>

<p>When the 2nd iteration will be finalized, we will have the Ultimate World’s Trails Bucket List. For each new trail which makes the cut, we will release a special edition NFT to commemorate the achievement.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, we will have a democratically recommended, ready-to-go bucket list of places hikers do not want to miss. This could help people prioritize where they want to go next.</p>

<p>We are streamlining the process of people getting their best hiking life. We see value in that.</p>
